# POS System Selection Project

**Project Manager:** Mugilan  
**Duration:** 4 weeks  
**Objective:** Select optimal Point of Sale system for eyewear retail operations  
**Budget Impact:** $5,812 cost savings achieved  

## Project Overview

Led comprehensive evaluation of three POS systems (Ginesis, Logic, Wondersoft) to support strategic technology decision for eyewear retail expansion. Managed end-to-end project from stakeholder requirements gathering through data analysis to executive recommendation delivery.

## Business Challenge

**Problem Statement:**  
Organization required POS system selection for eyewear retail operations with complex workflow requirements including frame selection, lens customization, coating options, and Easyecom platform integration.

**Key Constraints:**  
- Budget limitations requiring 3-year TCO analysis
- Integration complexity with existing Easyecom platform
- Staff training and change management considerations
- 4-week decision timeline for market expansion

## Project Approach

### Phase 1: Requirements Analysis (Week 1)
**Stakeholder Engagement:**
- Conducted interviews with retail operations team
- Analyzed current workflow inefficiencies
- Documented integration requirements with Easyecom platform
- Established evaluation criteria and weighting methodology

**Deliverables:**
- Requirements specification document
- Evaluation framework with weighted criteria (Cost 35%, Integration 25%, Features 20%, Usability 20%)

### Phase 2: Data Collection & Analysis (Week 2-3)
**Vendor Assessment:**
- Coordinated vendor demonstrations and technical assessments
- Collected pricing, feature, and integration complexity data
- Developed comprehensive datasets covering 84 evaluation points
- Created financial models for 3-year total cost of ownership

**Risk Assessment:**
- Evaluated implementation timelines and complexity
- Assessed vendor stability and support capabilities
- Analyzed integration development requirements and costs

### Phase 3: Decision Support & Recommendation (Week 4)
**Executive Dashboard Development:**
- Created interactive Power BI dashboard for stakeholder review
- Developed 6-page analytical framework covering all evaluation dimensions
- Implemented scenario modeling for different business conditions
- Prepared executive presentation with clear recommendation
